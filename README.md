Crude overview/expos√©-like kludge tested on labwc 0.91 to visually display the current tasks and make them active/focused. It aims to 
be a makeshift replacement for skippy-xd on X/openbox. It might end up working on other wayland compositors, as well. 

No window previews, at the moment: just big (beautiful) buttons that get the job done...

- make sure to install: wlrctl
- make sure to install the required python dependencies
- chmod +x tasklist-overview.py
- bind it to a convenient key combo / mouse button (rc.xml on labwc)
